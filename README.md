# Draggable Background

A jQuery plugin to make background images draggable.

**NOTE:** I don't plan to maintain this library anymore since I've moved on
from jQuery. There seems to be requests for supporting different options
for background-size or different units for background-position. After looking
at the css spec for these properties, it seems unmaintainable to support every
possible configuration, so I would encourage you to fork this and shape it to
your specific needs.

## Configuration
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Option</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Known Values</th>
    <th>Default Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>bound</td>
    <td>Boolean</td>
    <td>true|false</td>
    <td>true</td>
    <td>Whether dragging is bounded by the edges of the image.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>axis</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>x|y</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>If specified, restrict dragging along x or y axis.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>units</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>pixels|percent</td>
    <td>pixels</td>
    <td>If the plugin should set the background position using pixels or percentages. Percentages are useful if your image area is responsive and may change size but retain the aspect ratio.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>done</td>
    <td>Function</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Called when dragging is stopped by mouseup, touchup, or mouseleave.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Usage
```js
// default options
$('div').backgroundDraggable();

// only draggable in the x direction, and dragging is not bounded by the image
$('div').backgroundDraggable({ bound: false, axis: 'x' });

// disable draggable background
$('div').backgroundDraggable('disable');

// callback when drag complete
$('div').backgroundDraggable({
  done: function() {
    backgroundPosition = $('div').css('background-position');
    console.log(backgroundPosition);
  }
});
```

## Support
IE9+. Only `background-size` value of `auto` (default) and `cover` are supported. `background-position` must be absolute pixels. There will be bugs if you use `center` for percentages.
